The simplest useful program that uses Erlang/OTP features I could think of. Website monitoring needs concurrency (Erlang) and reliability (OPT) . This OTP server monitors a list of sites and shows a heartbeat when all is well and a warning when one goes down. It's mean to be basic but email, twitter and lava lamp support may follow :)
